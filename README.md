# Technical_Test

Looking around the dnv website, the job apply platform caught my attention, so my high summarized TestPlan is about this functionality. I would classify this test as a quick regression to check the functionality. I know that a detailed test would be much more complete and a simple Smoke would be much shorter.

About the second part of the test, the report ticket, I have used an edited image, so it is a fake bug. I have not found any bug on the web.

As I said to Juan Francisco, I haven't automated tests yet. My intention was to automate tests little by little to dedicate myself to it. Therefore, I have used Selenium IDE to build some automated tests thanks to the recording functionality that Selenium IDE has. Besides recording the movements, I added some asserts and other commands.

To run these tests, you need to have downloaded the Selenium IDE pluggin in Chrome. When you run the extension, you will have to open an existing project, selecting the attached file called "DNV project.side".

In one of the test, RegisterApplyInterface, you have to change the user and password to pass it. Select the step and change the Value field with a correct one.
